    <h2>What is Codewars?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars</a> is an <i>educational community</i> for computer programming.</li>
        <li>On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as <i>kata</i>.</li>
        <li>These discrete programming exercises train a range of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online integrated development environment.</li>
    </ul>

            This repository will include all of my Codewars solutions (to this date), filtered by:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Programming langauge</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Kyu / Dan (level of difficulty)</strong></li>
            <ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>The lower the  <strong><code>kyu</code></strong> and the higher the <strong><code>dan</code></strong>, the tougher the challenges become.

        <li>
            <strong>Please acknowledge</strong> the following points when attempting to find a kata solution:
            <ol>
                <li>Due to file names not accepting colons (<strong><code>:</code></strong>), I have replaced this symbol with either an empty space (<strong><code>" "</code></strong>) or dash symbol (<strong><code>"-"</code></strong>).</li>
                <li>Next, if you cannot find the kata you are searching for, try locating it in the <strong><code>Beta</code></strong> folder (<i>some katas may have been approved since I initially uploaded them...</i>).</li>
                <li>Lastly, I've been obliged to remove all question marks from file names, due to strict file formatting rules.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
