    <h2>What is Codewars?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars</a> is an <i>educational community</i> for computer programming.</li>
        <li>On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as <i>kata</i>.</li>

            <ol>
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>Due to file names not accepting colons (<strong><code>:</code></strong>)</li> I have replaced this symbol with either an empty space (<strong><code>" "</code></strong>) or dash symbol (<strong><code>"-"</code></strong>). Acknowledge this when looking for a kata.
        <li>In addition, if you cannot locate the kata you are searching for, try locating it in the <strong><code>Beta</code></strong> folder.
            <br>(<i>some katas may have been approved since I first uploaded them...</i>)
